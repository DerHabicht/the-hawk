      Hi, I'm Robert. I am a programmer by trade and I write Science Fiction on the side.
      My go-to language is Python, but I also have experience with Java, bare metal C,
      C++, Javascript, and Bash. I've recently become interested in Go and it is quickly
      topping my list of go-to languages (no pun intended&hellip; okay, maybe a little).
